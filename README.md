## Current Projects

### 1. **Movie Recommendation System** ðŸŽ¬
   **Objective:** Build a system that recommends movies to users based on their preferences.
   
   **Tech Stack:**
   - Language: Python
   - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, sklearn, ast, nltk, pickle, streamlit

   **Approach:**
   - **Dataset:** The dataset was sourced from [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for movie details and metadata.
   - **Model:** Used cosine similarity on vectorized movie features to recommend similar movies.
   - **Posters:** Integrated OMDb API for fetching movie posters and details.
   - **UI:** Developed an interactive interface with Streamlit for user-friendly recommendations.

   **Status:** Work in progress. Stay tuned!
