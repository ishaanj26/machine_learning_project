# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! ðŸš€ This is a dedicated space where I will explore and implement various machine learning projects, starting from beginner-level concepts to more advanced applications. Each project will include code, explanations, and relevant datasets to help you follow along or use it for your learning journey.

```

## Current Projects

### 1. **Movie Recommendation System** ðŸŽ¬
   **Objective:** Build a system that recommends movies to users based on their preferences.
   
   **Tech Stack:**
   - Language: Python
   - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, from sklearn.feature_extraction.text -> CountVectorizer, ast, from nltk.stem.porter -> PorterStemmer,from sklearn.metrics.pairwise->         
     cosine_similarity,pickle,streamlit

   **Approach:**
   - **Dataset:** Leverage a public dataset like [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) for movie ratings.
   - **Model:** Use collaborative filtering techniques (e.g., user-based or item-based filtering).
   - **Evaluation:** Evaluate the system using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).

   **Status:** Work in progress. Stay tuned!
